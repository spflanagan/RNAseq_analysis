Purpose: Take the groups.txt file output by orthomcl and pull out all of the sequences 
Usage:
(I)nteractive or (H)elp?
Convert OrthoMCL 'groups.txt' output to fasta (./om_groups_to_fasta)
Converts orthomcl output to fasta format
-g: Groups file, including path
-f: Fasta file name, including path. Can provide multiples, but must be separated by commas
-n: If this is the original nucleotide file without corrected headers, follow -n flag with species code. If it has the appropriate header, input false
-o: output directory name
-h: Output the usage message
no arguments: interactive mode

This program creates fasta files from the groups.txt file output by orthomcl. 
You must tell the program if the input nucleotide file(s) (-f flag) have the corrected header, and if they do, provide the species code.

For example:

./om_groups_to_fasta -g home/orthomcl_dir/groups.txt -f /home/orthomcl_dir/compliantFasta/cam.fasta -n cam -o /home/orthomcl_dir/output/
